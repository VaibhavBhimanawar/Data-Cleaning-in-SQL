# Data-Cleaning-in-SQL
🏠 Nashville Housing Data Cleaning (SQL)
📌 About

This project focuses on data cleaning using SQL on the Nashville Housing dataset. The dataset contained raw, inconsistent, and unstructured values that required cleaning to ensure accuracy, consistency, and readiness for analysis.

🧹 Data Cleaning Tasks

The following steps were performed using SQL:

Standardizing date formats for consistency

Populating missing values with appropriate replacements

Removing duplicates to eliminate redundant records

Splitting combined data (e.g., addresses into city, state, and ZIP)

Normalizing text formats using UPPER(), LOWER(), and TRIM()

Dropping unused columns to optimize the dataset

Correcting inconsistencies with CASE WHEN statements and joins

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server (or any RDBMS)
